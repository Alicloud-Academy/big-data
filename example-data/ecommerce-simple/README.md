# Retail Example Data

- Status: **OK**
- Notes: Code tested and working as of 2021-03-15 (YYYY-MM-DD), though you really don't need to run the code: just use the sample data as-is.

## What

This repository contains a fake retail dataset, generated by `genData.py` (which relies on `countries.csv` for a list of Alpha-2 country codes and country names).

The output of `genData.py` is a set of user, product, and order data, stored in `users.csv`, `orders.csv`, and `products.csv` respectively. Those documents are all included in the repository, but feel free to generate your own using `genData.py`. You can adjust the number of users, orders, and products generated by changing the corresponding variables at the top of `genData.py`. 

This data can be loaded into MaxCompute tables or a traditional MySQL database to use in demos and experiments in DataV, QuickBI, or DataWorks.

## How

Create a database or DataWorks project, then load in the data from the CSV files. As for code, you're on your own! Explore and experiment.
